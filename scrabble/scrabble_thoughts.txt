To Do
[x] Create a function to calculate points given a word
[x] Create a Rack class
[x] Create function to display rack with tiles in terminal
[x] Create a function to assign 7 random letters to the rack
[x] Create a Tile Bag class
[x] Create a function to assign 7 tiles at random from the tile bag to the rack
[] 

-------------------------------------
Approaches
- Used a match case statement for calculating points
- Use a list to store the alphabet tiles and pass this when instantiating a rack

- Use a string with all the Upper case alphabets and use random.choice to pick a random letter

- Create a dictionary where the values are the alphabets to tiles and key is how many of those tiles are in the bag
- Values of the dictionary would be in a list

- 


-------------------------------------
Problems/ Errors to Fix
- TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object is not subscriptable
- This occurs when the final for loop is being run; Maybe the dictionary item is not being accessed?
- FIXED: The error was due to me using [] square brackets instead of () after append 


-------------------------------------
Keep in Mind
- There are 98 tiles in total; Returning length of self.tiles in Tilebag confirms this
